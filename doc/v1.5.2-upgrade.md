# Upgrading from <=1.5.1

From Avalon v1.5.2 onwards, blocks data are appended to and read from a file called `blocks.bson`, which is also the mongo dump file obtained using `mongodump`. This is to take load off the main MongoDB database which results in decreased RAM usage and increased indexing efficiency.

To upgrade your node (assuming Avalon is not running):

1. Run a `git pull`. Resolve conflicts for `start.sh` file if required.
2. Install latest node dependencies.
```
npm i
```
2. Create the dump file for blocks collection.
```
mongodump -d avalon -c blocks
```
3. Drop the blocks collection from the mongo database.
```
mongosh avalon --eval "db.blocks.drop()"
```
4. Specify the full path to the folder containing the `blocks.bson` file with `BLOCKS_DIR` env var which may also be found in `start.sh` script.
5. Restart `mongod` to realize RAM usage savings.
6. Start Avalon. It should create a file called `blocks.index` which contains the pointers of each block to the `blocks.bson` file (each block takes up exactly 8 bytes of indexing). This may take some time to complete.

The file `blocks.metadata.json` file generated from `mongodump` is not required by Avalon, and can be deleted safely.

## Transaction history

Transaction history are now indexed separately with env var `TX_HISTORY`. If `/tx` and `/history` APIs are needed, a full rebuild is required to create the indexes.
